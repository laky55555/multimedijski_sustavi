There are 2 programs that you can execute:

1) testing_one.m that accepts 3 arguments:
	- number of different people/directories for trening set
	- number of signs per person/directory trening set
	- path to sign that we will test on trening data
	Example: testing_one(5,5,'potpisi/ivan.txt');

2) testing_all.m that accepts 4 arguments:
	- number of different people/directories for trening set
	- number of signs per person/directory trening set
	- number of people/directories that we will test on trening set
	- number of signs for each person that we will test on trening set
	Example: testing_all(5,2,5,5);
	We recomend that first argument is equal or greater than third so that 
	for each person that we compare sign have at least one example of that person.
	We recomend that second argument is smaller than fourth so the program 
	can test sign that is not already in training set.

Requirements:
	- programs: load_data.m, do_svd.m, find_closest_matrix.m
	- directory structure: in current directory there must be programs mentioned earlier,
						   directory "potpisi" in which there are directories "nameX" where
						   X is positive integer greater than 0, in which are textual files
						   "koordinateX.txt" where X is positive integer greater than 0 that
						   is output of processing program potpis.pde.
